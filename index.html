            <h3> Who i am:</h3>
            <p>Hi! Nice to meet you. I'm Kevin, i live in Italy, near Trento (the north side of italy) and i'm trying to learn web developing. It's my first time and i hope it will be funny and usefull.
                I am 29 years old, i live with my girlfriend and i have a big dog called Haru. Haru means 'spring' in Japanese. I love gaming, i love spending time with my family and my friends and i love to travel. 
                I work in a steel mill at the moment but i hope, one day, to learn what i need to change my work in something more 'stimulant' than this one. 
            </p>
